h1. ScriptHash

**ScriptHash** is a simple and pure JavaScript hashing tool using bcrypt.js for generating hashes.

It's main design goal is combine command line use (via Node.js) with the option to easily calculate passwords on-the-go via a simple web form.

Conceptionally the target domain is to be used as salt. However, the user may decide to utilize any other string.

As the resulting hash is cut down to the configured size, revelation of the original password is unlikely.
